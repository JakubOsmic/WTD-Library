# WTD-Library
Wind Turbine Dynamics (WTD) Library features a group of Simulink blocks for simulation of dynamic response of generic models of Wind Turbine Generators (WTG) on power system disturbances, which includes the General Electric (GE) Doubly Fed Induction Generator (DFIG) model. The WTD Library features a set of Simulink blocks that models GE DFIG as well as conventional steam and hydro generating units that are connected to a transmission grid. The Library also includes a set of Matlab m and S functions which are used for power flow calculation and initialization of state variables of the models of GE DFIG and conventional steam and hydro generating units. The WTD library is an open source simulation tool primarily aimed for educational/research purpose since it enables incorporation of user-defined Simulink models. The Library is especially suitable for development and testing of new algorithms for the control of WTG, like virtual inertia and primary frequency control algorithms.
